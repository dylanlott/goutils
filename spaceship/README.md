spaceship
=========

We are contractors that have been hired to build a spaceship game. 

It is supposed to emulate reality as closely as possible but we have time to build it.

The contract is spaced out to build it from the ground up. 

Specifications
==============

## Spec 1: Build the basic frame. 

* Constructor functions usually are called something like New or Create
e.g. `func New() {}` and are usually meant to abstract away the packages
logic at build time.

* They are good practice for top level packages
that you want to expose to the end user.

Get your TestNew function running and passing tests and then work on the rest.

- [ ] Write a function that returns the ship's ID
## Spec 3: Engine
